Data Analytics

## PRACTICAL EXERCISE 


Consider the _Cinema.csv_ data-set. This data-set contains data of over 46000 movies from 1874 to
2016 with their title, year of release, rating, runtime, genre, imdb Rating, and country.

a. Read this data into Python Pandas as a DataFrame.
b. Check column information for the data.
c. Convert the unit of the budget and gross columns from $ to million $ first by
dividing by 1,000,000.
d. Rename the budget and gross columns to budget(Million $) and
gross(Million $).
e. Create a new column called profit which contains the difference of the two columns:
gross(Million $) and budget(Million $).
f. Sort the data-frame using the profit column as reference.
g. Extract the top ten profiting movies in descending order and store them in a new data-
frame called top10.
h. Plot a scatter or a joint plot between the columns budget and profit. Make any
observations on the scatter graph.
i. Extract the movies with a negative profit and store them in a new data-frame called
Neg_profit.
j. Plot a bar graph of genre_1 movies.
